* create jupyter-book (base on NetAScore AGILE 2024?)

* how to set up ors instance
  -> set up ors instance with different pbf files
  -> new config capabilities :)
  -> "historic" routing: use old geofabrik pbf instances
[enhance ors docs]

* osm-transform:
  * expand README for capabilities
  * Roadmap:
    * get pbf
    * filter pbf
    * get DEM
    * enrich w/ DEM
      -> show capabilities of ors
    * get boundaries
    * enrich w/ Boundaries
      -> show capabilities of ors
[enhance README]

* Usage example ORS universe: Nearest POI:
  0. Get isochrone for "in X radius"
  1. POI query from given position with corresponding radius
  2. matrix query for found POIs
  3. route generation for nearest POI(s)
[ turn to blogpost?]

--- OPTIONAL ---
* use ohsome-extracts in ORS?
  -> create corresponding query
  -> extract to pbf
